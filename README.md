# Catalog application

This is a database-driven web application. The project initialises a database of users, catalogs (catalogues)) and items, populates the database with some hypothetical examples, and creates a web application that public users can read catalogs and items from the database on an internet browser. Users can log in with their Google+ or Facebook accounts to create their own catalogs and items. Only authenticated catalog creators have authorisations to update and delete their catalogs and items.

# How to run?

1. Run **database_setup.py** to create the database

2. Run **examples.py** to populate the database

3. run **catalog.py** and navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser
